  <li><strong> Bandaje Falls, also known as Bandaje Arbi Falls, is a picturesque waterfall located in the Kudremukh section of the Western Ghats in Karnataka's Dakshina Kannada district. It requires a trek through dense forests and grasslands. The waterfall cascades from a height of approximately 200 feet, creating a serene and beautiful natural setting. During the summer months, the flow of water may diminish, making it an ideal time for trekking and enjoying the surrounding scenery.</strong> </li>

  </li><strong>After planning for about a month, my 10 friends and I were finally ready to head out to Bandeje Falls, a beautiful spot hidden deep in the forest. We had booked a tempo traveler for the trip and left at 11:30 PM on Friday night. With Nittesh along, we knew there would be dancing, and sure enough, we danced our hearts out to item songs until around 2:00 AM. We had so much fun that we almost missed Hassan, but eventually, we got tired and fell asleep.<br>
    <br>

    We drove through Kotgehara and arrived at our homestay, Sudarshan Homestay, at around 6:00 AM. To be honest, it was a really nice place to stay. We rested on the beds for about 30 minutes, then got ready in our trekking outfits, packed our bags, and headed out for the trek.
    
    <br>
    <br>It was raining when we started, so we put on our raincoats and walked along the muddy trail. Everyone in the group was quick, but my friend Sharan and I lagged behind because we were too busy taking pictures and shooting videos (laughs). The fog was thick, so we couldn’t see much of the scenery, but we kept going.
    
    After almost three hours of trekking, we finally reached Bandeje Falls. The sight was amazing—the waterfall flowing down the cliffs was beautiful. We spent a lot of time there, enjoying the view and taking some daring photos, like one where I sat on the edge of the cliff, even though some people around us were worried.
    
    <br><br>On the way back, the fog cleared up for a short time around 1:45 PM, giving us a clear view of the surroundings for about seven minutes before the fog returned. I also had some fun playing in a small natural jacuzzi created by a mini-waterfall along the trail.
    
    When we got back to the starting point, we found a Maggie corner where we had to try the noodles. Eating hot Maggi noodles in the cool weather while we were still wet from the trek was the perfect ending to the day.
    
    <br><br>By the time we got back to the homestay in the evening, we were tired but happy. We spent the rest of the evening talking about the day’s adventure, sharing laughs, and planning our next trip. It was a day we would always remember, filled with friendship, fun, and the beauty of nature.
