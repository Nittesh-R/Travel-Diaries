  </li><strong>between the Western and Eastern Ghats lies BR Hills, also known as Biligiriranga Hills—a place that captivated me so much, I visited it twice. Each time, I discovered new layers of its natural beauty and spiritual richness.</strong> </li>
</li><strong>My first visit was during the monsoon season. We set off from Bengaluru early in the morning, passing through Malvalli and reaching Yellanduru, our entry point to BR Hills. The misty surroundings and the sight of deer and elephants along the way added to the magic of the journey.</strong> </li> 
<li><strong>

 </li><strong>At the summit, we found the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple. Though it was undergoing renovations, the temple was still vibrant with rituals honoring deities like Biligiri Ranganatha and Alumelamma (Lakshmi). We were fortunate to witness a special pooja dedicated to Lord Hanuman, known as "Apura Gopura," which was a deeply moving experience.</strong> </li>
 <li><strong>
 </li><strong>From the temple, we enjoyed sweeping views of green hills and tiny villages below—a scene that felt straight out of a painting. It was incredibly peaceful and refreshing, surrounded by such natural beauty.</strong> </li>
 <li><strong>
 </li><strong>For those looking for more adventure, K Gudi offers thrilling safari experiences just a short drive away from BR Hills. Staying in a local hotel enhances the safari experience and allows for a deeper connection with nature.</strong> </li>

 </li><strong>My visits to BR Hills were more than just trips—they were journeys that combined nature’s beauty with cultural richness. Whether you’re seeking spiritual solace, wildlife encounters, or simply a break from city life, BR Hills offers an unforgettable experience. I’m excited to share more stories from my safari adventure in my next blog post.</strong> </li>
